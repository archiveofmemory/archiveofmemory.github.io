<h1>Archive of Collective Memory</h1>
<p>Mobile text-only site</p>
<p>The Archive of Collective Memory is an interactive public art installation as part of the 2023 Art Shanty Projects in Mpls, Minnesota. 
   The Archive offers an opportunity to visitors to reflect on the nature of representation and the relationship between individual and collective memory. 
   On the exterior walls of its hexagonal wooden structure, the Archive will host a network of capacitive sensors which respond to the movement of participants with live audio.
<br>
   On the final day of the Art Shanties, the Archive will play back its contents – the accumulated music from the sensed movement - offering a space for reflection on what has been collectively represented and stored within the Archive.
</p>

<p>
    We encourage participants to reflect on a few questions when they visit the Archive:
    <br>
What is the distance between what sound generated from your movement and your movement itself? 
<br>

What will be stored or included in the Archive? What will be lost? 

<br>
Did your movements always generate the expected response from the Archive? 
<br>

Was there a clear point at which the responses became expected or anticipated? How would you describe such a moment?
<br>

How did your movements change over the course of discovering what effects came from your movements? 
<br>

What were you able to successfully "store" within the Archive? 

<br>
Does individual memory in modern society function more or less like an archive? Does collective memory function like an archive? Why or why not?
<br><br>
