<p><b>About the Archive</b></p>
<p>The Archive of Collective Memory is an interactive public art installation as part of the 2023 Art Shanty Projects. 
   <br>
   The Archive offers an opportunity to visitors to reflect on the nature of representation, archives, and the relationship between individual and collective memory. From within its hexagonal wooden structure, the Archive plays audio transcribed from audience member's text inputs into music. 
   <br>
   Each weekend, the Archive will collect these submissions and add them to the Archive. 
   <br><br>
   This first weekend, the Archive will playback a transcription of an translated work by Maurice Halbwachs (1877–1945). 
   In the work, Halbwachs' describes his conception of "collective memory". 
   <br><br>
   On the final day of the Art Shanties, the Archive will play back its contents - the accumulated music from all submissions to the archive - offering a space for reflection on what has been collectively represented and stored within the Archive.
</p>
<p>We enourage visitors to reflect on the nature of memory, representation, sound, and archives. A few questions to consider during or after your visit:
   <br>
<ul>
   <li><i>What are the limitations of what can possibly be represented in the Archive of Collective Memory?</i></li>
   <li><i>What is an archive? What satifies the conditions of being an archive?</i></li>
   <li><i>What is the relationship between individual and collective memory?</i></li>
    <li><i>How is individual memory alike or dislike an archive? And collective memory? Does either more resemble an archive than the other?</i></li>
   <li><i>What <b>should</b> we remember inidivudally and collectively? Where do these come apart, come together?</i></li>
</ul>
</p>

<i>Coming soon</i></p>
