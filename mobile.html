<p>About the Archive</p>
<p>The Archive of Collective Memory is an interactive public art installation as part of the 2023 Art Shanty Projects in Mpls, Minnesota. 
   <br>
   The Archive offers an opportunity to visitors to reflect on the nature of representation and the relationship between individual and collective memory. 
   <br>
   From within its hexagonal wooden structure, the Archive plays audio transcribed from audience member's text inputs into music. 
   <br>
   Each weekend, the Archive will collect these submissions and add them to the Archive. 
   <br>
   This first weekend, the Archive will playback a transcription of an translated work by Maurice Halbwachs (1877–1945). 
   In the work, Halbwachs' describes his conception of "collective memory". 
   <br>
   On the final day of the Art Shanties, the Archive will play back its contents – the accumulated music from all submissions to the archive - offering a space for reflection on what has been collectively represented and stored within the Archive.
</p>
<br>
<p>We enourage visitors to reflect on the nature of memory, representation, sound, and archives. A few questions to consider during or after your visit:
   <br>
<i>What are the limitations of what can possibly be represented in the Archive of Collective Memory?</i>
<i>What is an archive? What satifies the conditions of being an archive?</i>
<i>What is the relationship between individual and collective memory?</i>
<i>How is individual memory alike or dislike an archive? And collective memory? Does either more resemble an archive than the other?</i>
<i>What <b>should</b> we remember inidivudally and collectively? Where do these come apart, come together?</i>
</p>

<p>Further Reading</p>
<p><i>Coming soon</i></p>
