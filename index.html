<p><b>About the Archive</b></p>
<p>The Archive of Collective Memory is an interactive public art installation as part of the 2023 Art Shanty Projects. 
   <br><br>
   The Archive offers an opportunity for its visitors to reflect on the nature of representation, archives, and the relationship between individual and collective memory. From within its hexagonal wooden structure, the Archive plays music translated from Archive visitor's text-based submissions. 
   <br><br>
   At the end of each installation day, the Archive will collect and translate these submission by an algorithm designed by the artists before being added to the Archive. This algorithm, roughly speaking, translates individual letters and numbers into indiviual notes of a scale without halfsteps (to arbitrarily remove dissonance). Vowels in words introduce varying forms of rhythym while spaces introduce silence.
   <br><br>
   On the final day of the Art Shanties, the Archive will play back its contents <i>in extenso</i> - the accumulated music from all submissions to the archive - offering a space for reflection on what has been collectively represented and stored within the Archive.
</p>
<p>We enourage visitors to reflect on the nature of memory, representation, sound, and archives. A few questions to consider during or after your visit:
   <br>
<ul>
   <li><i>What are the limitations of what can possibly be represented in the Archive of Collective Memory?</i></li>
   <li><i>What is an archive? What satisfies the conditions of being an archive?</i></li>
   <li><i>What is the relationship between individual and collective memory?</i></li>
   <li><i>How is individual memory alike or dislike an archive? And collective memory? Does either resemble an archive more than the other?</i></li>
   <li><i>What should we remember as individuals? In what ways should we remember? What should we forget? Why?</i></li>
   <li><i>How or in what manner should we remember as a society?</i></li>
   <li><i>What role do archives play in social memory?</i></li>
</ul>
